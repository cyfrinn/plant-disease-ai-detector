# plant-disease-ai-detector

This project uses machine learning to detect plant bacterial diseases based on images. It features a trained model that classifies diseases affecting crops like tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. A simple graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter allows users to upload images and view predictions.

## Features
- Upload an image of a plant leaf.
- Get real-time predictions on whether the plant is infected with a bacterial disease.
- Built with TensorFlow and Keras.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/cyfrinn/plant-disease-ai-detector.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd plant-disease-ai-detector

3. Install the required dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Run the application:
`python app.py`

2. Upload an image of a plant leaf and click on "Predict Disease" to get the result.

## Model
You can download the trained model from [[Google Drive here](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1q4yWGzhpbB8tfqx-vFcxQdtRiBUvK853)].

The model is trained to detect bacterial diseases in plants like:
- Pepper Bacterial Spot
- Potato Early Blight
- Tomato Leaf Mold, etc.
